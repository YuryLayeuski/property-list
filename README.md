# Code and Design Decisions

- Build single page React app based on the mockup
- Build 4 components(Header, Loading, Property and PropertyList)
- Implement routing (used HashRouter instead of BrowserRouter to fix the Netlify redirect issue)
- Implement cache in local storage as per requirements
- Implement favorite property functionality
- Add some Cypress tests to test the whole functionality of the app

Honestly, I spent around 4-5 hours, most of the difficult for me was CSS styling, because I don't have a lot of experience with CSS
